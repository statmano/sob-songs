      <h1>Top Songs of 2025</h1>
      <p class="outer-text">
        Well I underestimated just how much time and attention raising a 1-year-old takes so I didn't focus a ton on finding much new music. Hey that's on me, I get it. However I did come across some new songs that I'd still like to share, so here are my Top Songs of 2025 (that I first heard in 2025)<br /><br />
        *<i>As always I try to stay away from posting any songs that went completely
        mainstream as you all are probably aware of them already.  Here are
        some ones that may have flown under the radar that I really appreciated
        and the reasons why. Some you may like, some you may not, that's fine- but if you do
        like them, please try to show some appreciation to the musicians by
        either supporting them or just sharing their music with others.</i>

        <h1>"Bottle of Luv" by Nico Bones</h1>
        <p>
          The first one out of the gate was kind of surprising to me as Nico Bones brings back the old classic rock sound of the 80's and early 90's. Sounds a bit like what a Black Crowes song would be mixed with some of the party hair bands as well. This whole album, although short, was a pretty good listen and I recommened if you like that style of music. (But also can we also bring back proper spelling and capitalization to song titles... I mean, "luv"?, seriously?)

        <h1>"No Getting Over You" by The Lone Bellow</h1>
        <p>
          Having a little one means a lot of time trying to find soft songs for them to fall asleep to. Although my little guy seemed to prefer "Tougher Than the Rest" by Bruce Springsteen to doze off to, this song here was one that could put me in that relaxed mode to drift off to.

        <h1>"Kick" by Militarie Gun</h1>
        <p>
          A bit of the antithesis of the previous song, this one comes at you with some relentless noise. This was definitely the most ear-wormy song of the year for me though as it got stuck in my head for a while after I first heard it. This isn't typically my type of music either, but their album actually was something I could play the whole way through surprisingly. This song and "Thought You Were Waving" were my two favorites... although pretty dark lyrics?

        <h1>"Snowboard" by The Supernaturals</h1>
        <p>
          We just finished the Christmas season and in trying to find some new Christmas songs to add to the rotation, this song crossed my path. I don't consider it really a Christmas song, just a nice Winter song with fuzzy guitars (I'm always a sucker for fuzzy guitars and synths- love em). Sadly this band doesn't have many songs that sound like this one, I kind of wish they'd embrace that sound though and bring some more out).

        <h1>"Darkness" by Pinegrove</h1>
        <p>
          A song from 2018? Yup, this one goes under the "I didn't know it existed until 2025. A nice track to just hang out to, has that pop sound to it but then changes things up a bit towards the end.

        <h1>"Shine" by Lastnerd</h1>
        <p>
          I don't even recall when I first heard this but it has a bit of that old 70's Commodores/EW&F sound with something that Daft Punk will probably sample a couple years from now. It's nothing special but for what I've heard during the year it's just a good song to groove to a bit.

        <h1>"Fast Cars & Superstars" by Christian Marchi</h1>
        <p>
          This was attached to an Instagram reel of some kids in some dance competition- got in my head, was humming it during a bowling night where I had a good night and the rest is history. Yes it's view count breaks into the millions but I'm letting it slide as I just hadn't heard a lot of new music this year.

        <h1>"Sally, When the Wine Runs Out" by ROLE MODEL</h1>
        <p>
          Ok yes this song went very big this year and shouldn't be on here- however it was the first song I put on the list way at the beginning of the year. Was cool to see it have the success it did though and it wasn't like ROLE MODEL was some huge band churning out hit after hit, so it made the list.
        </p>

    <p class="outer-text">
      That's it- that's my list for 2025. Hope you enjoyed some of these and I'm going to make a concerted attempt to get exposed to more new music in 2026 so that list will be extremely hard to choose my tops. Until then Happy New Year!
