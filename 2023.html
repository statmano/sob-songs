      <h1>Top Songs of 2023</h1>
      <p class="outer-text">
        It's the end of the year, here are my top songs of 2023. You'll notice
        the list is really short this year. "Did Sean just find amazing songs
        that others couldn't compete with?" or "Has Sean's musical tastes
        changed drastically and he wanted to showcase only those types of songs
        this year?" may be running through your heads right now. The answer,
        sadly, is "no" to both of them. The year 2023 apparently just wasn't
        that great for new music that wasn't completely mainstream. There wasn't
        much out there that I could find that that truly sounded really good to
        me, so yes this year's list is a little brief without many "holy hell
        that song was great!" additions. I still feel wanted to share the ones
        that did come across and see if maybe you like the mas wellso here they
        are, enjoy?<br /><br />
        *I try to stay away from posting any songs that went completely
        mainstream as you all are probably aware of them already, so here are
        some ones that may have flown under the radar that I really appreciated
        and why. Some you may like, some you may not, that's fine- but if you do
        like them, please try to show some appreciation to the musicians by
        either supporting them or just sharing their music with others.

        <h1>"Too Good At Raising Hell" by The Struts</h1>
        <p>
          An ok song to start things off with that actually has a rock sound to
          it (which can be hard to find these days). It's still a little
          repetitious and formulaic for me, but it was at least fun to listen to
          occasionally.

        <h1>"Fog Machine" by White Reaper</h1>
        <p>
          White Reaper makes another appearance on one of my yearly lists. A
          pretty solid song- has a good guitar solo in there (a guitar solo in
          2023?!) and some good drums too. Cool to see this band keep putting
          out good stuff and hey they were even featured on a Taco Bell
          commercial this year!

        <h1>"Pandemonium" by NF</h1>
        <p>
          Ok so this was a little mainstream- I heard it in Rocket League first
          and it blew up after a bit. I linked the lyrics version because, well,
          they are great. It's a very well written rap song that focuses on
          motivation and self-confidence instead of more typicla things like
          guns, false bravado, status, etc. The rest of NF's stuff on this album
          is very impressive too.

        <h1>"One Good Thing About Summer" by The Airport 77s</h1>
        <p>
          Ah the Airport 77s also making another appearance this year. This was
          because I had an incredibly hard time finding good new music so I went
          back to old lists and looked up if those bands had done anything new.
          This song (and the album it's on) technically came out in late 2022,
          but I didn't know about it until 2023 sooo. It's fun pop-punk stuff.
          There's quite a few songs from this album I could've put on here but I
          chose this one because it's an earworm and half and I just wanted to
          get it stuck in your head too 😎

        <h1>"Overcome" by Nothing But Thieves</h1>
        <p>
          You know me, I am a sucker for an 80s/synth-pop sound, this one gets
          close to that. This was a good background song for me when working and
          such (even as I type this I'm thinking "oh yea this is good to have on
          in the background" haha).

        <h1>"Sympathy" by Declan McKenna</h1>
        <p>
          I always have to include one kind of weird song in these lists and
          this is this year's. I don't know why but this song caught my ear in a
          good way- it's goofy with a goofy video. Probably not everybody's
          taste, but eh, I liked it.

        <h1>"Everything Dissolves" by Erik Voeks + The Ghosters</h1>
        <p>
          Total 90's Pete Droge/Matthew Sweet sound to this from a small band
          out in Kansas City. I always liked those types of songs to just relax
          to on a drive and such. This song makes me think that if the Farrelly
          Brothers made another road trip comedy, that it'd be included on the
          soundtrack.

        <h1>"Garment Bag" by Adam Melchor</h1>
        <p>
          This is the final song and it made the list because it just conincided
          with me getting a drum set so I can finally learn the drums. There
          isn't anything overly complicated about this by any means, the drum
          beat and little fills after the chorus was something I found subtle
          and cool. I think I was just mad that there isn't a lot of drums in
          new mainstream songs and this popped on SiriusXM right after that
          thought popped in my head. In any case, it was a relaxing summer song
          for me.

      That's it for this year. Short, I know and yes I wish there was more songs
      out there that are just like "whoa!" and hit you in the chest the first
      time you hear them. Maybe 2024 brings us that? Maybe I have to write them
      myself (haha talk about over-confidence huh? But who knows??). In any
      case, hope you enjoyed and let's have a great year ahead! clicks!
